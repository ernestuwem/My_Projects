1. Connectinell Customer Churn
This project is based on the Connectinell churn dataset, which is being extracted from the 10alytics class forum. This project aims to determine whether the customers of that particular telecom industry will leave the telecom services or not. I have used Python libraries and ML models for prediction and also to know the accuracy between actual and predicted values.
